The purpose of this Owners and Residents Manual is to provide information to assist Lot Owners and tenants to live harmoniously and safely at Grand Central Apartments. 
The scope of the Manual includes useful contact information for tradespeople who have knowledge and experience at Grand Central Apartments, moving in, around and out of the building, security, recreational facilities, procedures adopted by the Owners Corporation relevant to Lot Owners (such as renovation procedures), and the Owners Corporation Rules.
This Manual is updated as relevant information changes.

The Owners Corporation is regulated by the Owners Corporations Act 2006 (VIC), associated Regulations, other relevant laws and the Special Rules (see Annex 6) of the Owners Corporation.
At the Annual General Meeting, all Lot Owners set the annual budget, maintenance plan, annual levies, elect a Committee of Management, and consider any other relevant matters.
An Owners Corporation Manager is appointed to administer financial and regulatory matters. These matters include maintaining a register of Lot Owners, invoicing levy amounts, paying bills, communicating with Lot Owners and ensuring regulatory requirements are fulfilled (such as insurance).
A Building Manager is appointment to maintain common services within the building and grounds for the benefit of Lot Owners and residents. Services include the swimming pool, issue and control of Access Tokens, gardening, common area lighting and building safety systems.
The Committee of Management meets every two months, together with the Owners Corporation Manager and Facilities Manager. The Committee sets the strategic direction for the Owners Corporation, ensures the decisions made at the AGM are implemented and works with the principal service providers to monitor the on-going upkeep of and improvements to the building, and grounds.
Lot Owners are invited to observe Committee meetings. The agenda for, and minutes of meetings are distributed to all Lot Owners.
