        &lt;p&gt;You can write JSX and use React components within your Markdown thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mdxjs.com/&#34;&gt;MDX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;export const Highlight = ({children, color}) =&amp;gt; ( &amp;lt;span style={{

&lt;p&gt;I can write &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; alongside my &lt;em&gt;JSX&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You can write content using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.github.com/gfm/&#34;&gt;GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;markdown-syntax&#34;&gt;Markdown Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To serve as an example page when styling markdown based Docusaurus sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headers&#34;&gt;Headers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;h1---create-the-best-documentation&#34;&gt;H1 - Create the best documentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;h2---create-the-best-documentation&#34;&gt;H2 - Create the best documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;h3---create-the-best-documentation&#34;&gt;H3 - Create the best documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;h6---create-the-best-documentation&#34;&gt;H6 - Create the best documentation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emphasis&#34;&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis, aka italics, with &lt;em&gt;asterisks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;underscores&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong emphasis, aka bold, with &lt;strong&gt;asterisks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;underscores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined emphasis with &lt;strong&gt;asterisks and &lt;em&gt;underscores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikethrough uses two tildes. &lt;del&gt;Scratch this.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lists&#34;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another item â‹…â‹…* Unordered sub-list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual numbers don&amp;rsquo;t matter, just that it&amp;rsquo;s a number â‹…â‹…1. Ordered sub-list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And another item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â‹…â‹…â‹…You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&amp;rsquo;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â‹…â‹…â‹…To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.â‹…â‹… â‹…â‹…â‹…Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.â‹…â‹… â‹…â‹…â‹…(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unordered list can use asterisks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or minuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or pluses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an inline-style link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com&#34; title=&#34;Google&#39;s Homepage&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an inline-style link with title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a reference-style link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../blob/master/LICENSE&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a relative reference to a repository file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org&#34;&gt;You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or leave it empty and use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com&#34;&gt;link text itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.example.com&#34;&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.example.com&#34;&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;JavaScript syntax highlighting&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Python syntax highlighting&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(s)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let&#39;s throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;highlightMe&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;This line can be highlighted!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tables&#34;&gt;Tables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colons can be used to align columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tables&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Are&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Cool&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;col 3 is&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;right-aligned&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;$1600&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;col 2 is&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;centered&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;$12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;zebra stripes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;are neat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;$1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Markdown&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Less&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Pretty&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;renders&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nicely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockquotes&#34;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let&amp;rsquo;s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; into a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inline-html&#34;&gt;Inline HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;line-breaks&#34;&gt;Line Breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a line for us to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a &lt;em&gt;separate paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line is also a separate paragraph, but&amp;hellip; This line is only separated by a single newline, so it&amp;rsquo;s a separate line in the &lt;em&gt;same paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;admonitions&#34;&gt;Admonitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
